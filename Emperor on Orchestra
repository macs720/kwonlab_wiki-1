Running Emperor on Orchestra:

Running Emperor on the Orchestra cluster is very similar to running Emperor and Qiime on the command line. The only major difference is that I started an interactive job, using 
#bsub -Is â€¦

To familiarize yourself with running Qiime and emperor on the cluster, I recommend running through the qiime tutorial found at http://qiime.org/tutorials/illumina_overview_tutorial.html. The two major outputs that I generated through the tutorial were .html summary tables and the emperor .html file. 

.html outputs on Orchestra can be displayed through the command xdg-open file.html, which opens a firefox browser through the Xquartz/X11 client.

the make_emperor.py command generates a folder that contains an index.html file that, when clicked, creates the 3-d PCoA plots. The cluster does not support WebGL, so the pretty 3d picture cannot be displayed by through the xdg-open command.

Therefore, you need to copy the folder containing the emperor index.html and the emperor required resources to the local machine using the scp command
''' scp js656@transfer.orchestra.med.harvard.edu from to -r'''
Then, open the index file on your local machine, and enjoy the results
